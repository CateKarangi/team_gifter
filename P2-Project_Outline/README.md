## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Sendfriend is a journaling website designed for climbers to keep track of their "beta", a sequence of movements they used to climb (aka "send") a given route. Users will be able to share and compare their notes with other users. By keeping track of their performance they'll also be able to track how they've improved over time in their personal statistics page. As more users submit data and route descriptions we'll be able to provide suggestions for routes to users based on their strengths and weaknesses.
### Features
**User creation:** Users will be able to create an account and add/save routes and associated beta for that route to their profile.
**User statistics:** Users will be able to see a display of their performance over time.
**Beta sharing:** Users will be able to share their beta, either all of it, none of it, or specific routes with specific users ("friends").
**Route suggestions:** Users will be able to see routes that are tagged with certain climbing styles and see routes in a given area they may enjoy.
### Technologies
**Java**
**Spring Boot**
**Thymeleaf**
**MySQL**
**JavaScript**

### What I'll Have to Learn
**Google Maps API, or an equivalent:** For displaying climbing areas on an interactive map.
**JavaScript:** Used for displaying graphs and user performance statistics.
**JPA Annotations/MySQL:** Explore the most effective model implementations to enable sharing private/public user data.
