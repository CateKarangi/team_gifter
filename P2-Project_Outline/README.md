### Overview

  Not all campsites are created equal. For example, the private site with river access and a view versus the crowded site next to the dump station. Which is why my family has kept a folder full of campground maps with notes scribbled in the margins since before I was born. However, over that amount of time some maps have become illegible or simply lost. Which is why it is time for a digital solution, Best Campsite!
  Users will be able to login, search campgrounds, and mark campsites according to their tastes. Everyone has different judgement criteria for campsites. Which is why when marking sites users can write a brief description to remind themselves why they marked it in the first place. Then when a user is ready to plan their next trip they can go their user page to review their marked sites.
  
### Features

User Login: Users can create accounts, login, and a user page to review marked sites.
Campground Search: Users can search with a map interface and select campgrounds.
Mark Site: Users can view a list of all campsites and rate them as they see fit.

### What I'll Have to Learn

  Perhaps the most daunting and important thing I'll be learning will be getting data from an API and manipulating it. The data from Recreation Information Database will be JSON files, which I haven't work with before. I'll be using Google maps to display the campgrounds and that will require some JavaScript, which I'm unfamiliar with.
