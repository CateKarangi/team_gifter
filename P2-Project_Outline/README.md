## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I want to make an educational math game for children. It will involve listing 9 numbers and asking the child what the 10th number should be. The pattern will either be arithmetic or geometric, and the game itself will be played on site (using JavaScript). I will also keep track of each user's stats in a database (using phpMyAdmin and Python): Longest streak, current streak, win/loss percentage. The user will have the ability to reset the data at any point--returning all stats to 0.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn Javascript. I also plan to host this on my current website--graceerincallahan.com--so I'll want to figure out how to use FTP. I've been using WordPress up to this point, but I don't like it. I'll also want to revisit Bootstrap because we glanced at it in LC101, and I'm not solid on it just yet.

I'm also at the point of researching what the best framework would be because I haven't used Javascript before.
