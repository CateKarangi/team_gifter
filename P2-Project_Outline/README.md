# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I have an upcoming interview with Google based on completing the Foobar challenge, which is a light-hearted game that involves understanding numbers very well. In order to create a compelling project that aligns with the values I witnessed in the Foobar challenge, I would like to create and deploy a numbers-based game.

The game will give children an interactive space to practice completing patterns. It will involve listing 9 numbers and asking the child what the 10th number should be. The pattern will either be arithmetic or geometric, and the game itself will be played on site (using JavaScript). I will also keep track of each user's stats in a database (using phpMyAdmin and Python): Longest streak, current streak, win/loss percentage. The user will have the ability to reset the data at any point--returning all stats to 0.

In addition to putting the code on my GitHub page, I want to have it actively deployed on my website. (And I want to update my website so that it looks more attractive and has information about my interests and my goals.)

### Features
-Log-in
-Guessing Game
-Stats Tracking
-Stats Reset Option

### Extended Features
I would love to add some of the following fairly straightforward features if time allows:
- A button that takes the user to: Definitions of geometric and arithmetic patterns
- A button that takes the user to: Examples of practical uses of geometric and arithmetic sequences

### Technologies
-Javascript
-Python
-phpMyAdmin
-Flask?
-HTML/CSS

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn Javascript. I also plan to host this on my current website--graceerincallahan.com--so I'll want to figure out how to use FTP. I've been using WordPress up to this point, but I don't like it. I'll also want to revisit Bootstrap because we glanced at it in LC101, and I'm not solid on it just yet.

I'm also at the point of researching what the best framework would be because I haven't used Javascript before.
